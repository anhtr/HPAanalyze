# The case 

The Human Protein Atlas allow you to download very detailed data for each protein in the form of an xml file, and `hpaXmlGet` and `hpaXml` allow you to retrieve those files automatically from HPA server and parse them. However, due to technical limitation, you will not be able to save those `"xml_document"/"xml_node"` objects. The question is: How do you keep a version of these files to use when you are not connected to the internet, or for reproducibility?

# The solution

## Download and keep a local version of the xml files for yourself

Look at the ["Downloadable data"](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download) page from HPA website, you will see how these files are downloaded. Basically, you add `[ensembl_id].xml` to `http://www.proteinatlas.org` to download individual entries (that's what `hpaXmlGet` does behind the scene), or download the [whole big set](https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/proteinatlas.xml.gz).

From there, you can import the file using `xml2::read_xml()`. The output should be exactly the same as `hpaXmlGet`.

```{r}
## same as hpaXmlGet("ENSG00000134057")
CCNB1xml <- xml2::read_xml("data/ENSG00000134057.xml")
```

## Business as usual with `hpaXml` functions

Since the umbrella function `hpaXml` take either the *ensembl id* or the imported `xml_document` object, you can feed what you just imported to it and get the expected result.

```{r}
CCNB1_parsed <- hpaXml(CCNB1xml)
```

You can obviously use other `hpaXml` functions as well.

```{r}
protein_df <- hpaXmlProtClass(CCNB1xml)
tissue_df <- hpaXmlTissueExprSum(CCNB1xml)
antibody <- hpaXmlAntibody(CCNB1xml)
tissue_details_list <- hpaXmlTissueExpr(CCNB1xml)
rna_df <- hpaXmlRNAExpr(CCNB1xml)
```

## Save your parsed objects

It is recommended that you save your parsed objects for reproducibility. Unlike the `xml_document` object, these parsed objects are just regular R lists of standard vectors or data frames. You can save them just as usual.

```{r}
saveRDS(CCNB1_parsed, "data/CCNB1_parsed.rds")
```
